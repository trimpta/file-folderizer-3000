# file folderizer 3000
 Easy file organisation, 3000

To use: anytime you create/download/save a file, prefix a [folder] to its filename eg- "[images of obama]crying.png".
When you run the program, it automatically sorts every file which has a prefix to its corresponding folder, [images of obama]crying.png will be moved into a folder "images of obama" as "crying.png"

if the file already exists, the new file will be renamed with (copy) appended to its name.
